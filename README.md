  ## Data Wrangling of Seattle Traffic data
  - R code to demonstrate how to perform data cleansing using Seattle traffic data in R
  
  ## Diamond dataset Analysis
  - Exploratory Data Analysis on Diamond dataset, using histograms, scatterplots and boxplots in R
  
  ## Facebook Data Analysis 
  - Analyzed a 'pseudo-facebook' dataset using R, while studying Exploratory Data Analysis on Udacity, a course designed by Facebook.
  - Learned how to work with R packages like ggplot2, dplyr, reshape2, plotting histograms, scatterplots graphs with multiple variables and how these can be used to perform a basic exploratory analysis on a dataset.

  ## Game of Thrones Analysis
  - Exploratory data analysis on battles and character deaths in the Game of Thrones series using R
  ## Handwriting Character Recognition Analysis
  - Studying handwriting character recognition as a part of a Kaggle competition 
  - Identifying handwritten digits using MNIST data by performing Logistic regression and Random Forests
  ## Market Basket Analysis
  - Understanding customer buying patterns using a Groceries dataset
  - Implementing Apriori algorithms using R and data visualization using arules and arulesViz packages

  ## NYC Subway Ridership Analysis
  - Analyzing number of subway riders based on time of the day, day of week, weather conditions like rain, wind and temperature.
  - Analysis using Linear and OLS regression, implemented in python using sklearn, pandas, scipy and numpy
  ## RCpp_Example
  - Example to demonstrate how to embed C++ code snippet within an R function
  ## Sentiment Analysis
  - Sentiment Analysis using Twitter API in R. The program extracts tweets based on a specific keyword and builds sentiment graph and wordcloud depicting emotions using Bayesâ€™ theorem
  ## Titanic Dataset Analysis
  - Practicing exploratory data analysis and MAchine Learning algorithms in R by using the Titanic dataset which is provided as a Kaggle competition
